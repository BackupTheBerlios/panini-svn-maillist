+Panini l10n Framework
+---------------------
+USE CASES:
+
+1 Register Project (register_proj)
+  ---------------------------
+  Description: Developers register their projects for translation. This
+  means that the developer furnishes details about the project and does
+  an initial upload of the POT/PO file(s) into the system.
+
+  Actors: Developer
+
+  Assumptions: The developer is a registered user of the system and is
+  already logged in.
+
+  Steps: Developer clicks on `Register new project', furnishes meta-data
+  about the project and uploads the POT file into the system. If
+  the project already has some translations in a few languages, he
+  selects the languages and uploads the corresponding PO files. He then
+  provides a version number to the set of POT/PO files.
+
+  Non-Functional: TODO
+
+  Issues: TODO
+
+
+2 Manage Translations (manage_trans)
+  ----------------------------------
+  Description: The project admin can view project statistics and check
+  translation status. He can review translations and view / accept / reject
+  recommendations made by untrusted translators. He can also upload
+  newer versions of POT/PO files in different languages. If needed, he
+  can download the translated files for upstream syncing.
+
+  Actors: Developer/Project Admin
+
+  Assumptions: The project is registered and has received some
+  translations.
+
+  Steps: Admin clicks on `Projects > Project_Name > Manage'. He can then
+  view `Statistics', or incoming translations in different languages. To
+  upload a newer version of POT/PO files, he clicks on
+  `Upload_New_Version'. The process is similar to that during
+  register_proj. He then increments the version of the POT/PO file set.
+
+  Non-Functional: TODO
+
+  Issues: TODO
+
+
+3 Manage Users (manage_users)
+  ---------------------------
+  Description: The project admin can view the list of contributors to
+  the his project. He can elevate the status of untrusted translators to
+  trusted ones. He can add/delete translators, reviewers. He can also
+  give translators/reviewers admim privileges after which they will
+  become Project Admins.
+
+  Actors: Developer/Project Admin
+
+  Assumptions: The developer has admin privileges to the a registered
+  project which has one or more contributors.
+
+  Steps: Admin clicks on `Projects > Project_Name > Manage_Users'. He
+  can then view the list of `Contributors' and their contributions. From
+  and drop-down list, he can change the role/permission/status of the
+  user. He can also add new users to the project.
+
+  Non-Functional: TODO
+
+  Issues: TODO
+
+
+4 Translate (translate)
+  ---------------------
+  Description: The user can view current projects and can contribute
+  translations to the project in his chosen language(s).
+
+  Actors: Developer, Translator, Reviewer
+
+  Assumptions: The actor is a registered user and there are one or more
+  registered projects.
+
+  Steps: The user clicks on `Projects' and views the list of projects he
+  can contribute to. After selecting the project, the user selects his
+  preferred language (defaults to that in his profile prefs) and gets
+  some strings which he can translate. If he is untrusted, his
+  translations don't get into the main version and go directly to the
+  Reviewer/Admin. If he wishes to translate offline, there will be a way
+  to download the POT/PO file and later upload them back.
+
+  Non-Functional: TODO
+
+  Issues: TODO
+
+5 Review (review)
+  ---------------
+  Description: The reviewer reviews the list of translations and can
+  approve/deny them.
+
+  Actors: Reviewer
+
+  Assumptions: The user is registered and is approved by the Project
+  Admin as a Reviewer.
+
+  Steps: The user clicks on `Projects' and can view the list of
+  projects. After selecting the project, he will se the list of incoming
+  translations which can be filtered wrt various parameters like date,
+  status of user (trusted, untrusted), etc. Then he can either
+  review online where he'll be able to approve/deny/recommend
+  translations or he can also do it offline and later upload back. In
+  the offline method, unchanged strings mean approval, empty strings
+  will mean denial and fuzzy ones will mean recommendations.
+
+  Non-Functional: TODO
+
+  Issues: TODO
