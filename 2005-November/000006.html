 Platform:
 
-We propose using the Python scripting language with PostgreSQL RDBMS as
-a backend. The webserver will be Apache. We will be using other tools
-and frameworks not limited to Django, Subversion, Plone and Trac for
-scripting various parts of the project. Both Python and PostgreSQL are
-stable, mature and inherently secure and used worldwide on an immense
-range of products and applications. Further, python being an easy to

 to hack at and contribute to the project.
 
 Workflow:
 
-The Application developer registers an application and uploads the POT file.
-He also gives the file version. The application will treat each version of the
-PO file as a different file. The developer may opt for automatic
-translation, in which case all the strings available in the database will
-be translated into all the languages available and saved as drafts.
-Similarly, any translation by a non authorised translator will also be
-saved as drafts as and when they are done. The developer, and anyone
-authorised by him can approve of drafts, wholly or partially and merge them
-into the official version. This official version will be presented to all
-translators who wish to translate the file wholly or partially.

-lanuguage, all translations will be added and it is left to individual
-developers to choose the one they want.
