+After an IRC meet on Tue Oct 25, 2005 we reached a genral consensus on
+the following features --
+
+* Whether we will write an application or provide a service to the
+  people -- To be decided later
+
+* Statistics -- Must have  
+
+* Online Review -- Must have
+
+* Consistency Checking -- Must have
+
+* Version Control -- A basic form of VC should be there, nothing too
+  ambitious, but there will be a way to mark a PO file to be a part of x
+  version of y app while uploading. The app will in any case treat PO
+  files of different version as separate files. So in a way, the VC will
+  be at a higher level than the app itself
+
+* User Profiles -- Unnecessary
+
+* Management Console -- Not needed as volunteers will be able to take up
+  work via the stats page itself
+
+* Downloads -- A way to filter translations according to language,
+  product, etc. and download tarballs
+
+* Minor Points
+  -- Translated UI
+  -- Extensive Online Documentation
+  -- Email Interface
+  -- Screenshot Gallery (?)
+
+* TODO -- Think of more features to put in  
+
+It was also decided that we will try to hack on the Entrans JavaScript
+code to do the keymaps and integrate with our app. We'll acknowledge
+Entrans as the source of that code.
+  
+We have to state why we are doing a separate project and not joining an
+existing one: rosetta: not free pootle: in python, but no rdbms backend,
+so will not scale wordforge site itself seems to be broken.
+
+entrans: i personaly cannot join it as the languages are php and
+mysql. On the other hand it is an indian project with committed indian
+developers on it. We are also planning to use some of their javascript
+code. On the other hand, there is no project description so i dont know
+what they are planning.
+
+What software are we going to use and why?
+-- We'll of course use Django + PostgreSQL [+Apache/mod_python]
+
+storage of pot and po files in the rdbms or on the filesystem?
+
+django stores files and images on the filesystem with the path to the
+file in the database (default behaviour)
+-- We'll have to hack Django in such a way that we can store the
+POTfiles in the DB itself and not just the paths. [I guess it's very
+easily achievable since the PO file contains are part of the Model in
+any way]
+
+Can we use trac+svn in any manner?
+-- We'll have to investigate that, as I don't know anything about that
+at the moment. But if trac has a pluggable API which we can hook into
+via Django, then of course, why not?

+Web Based Translation / Translator Management Application
+---------------------------------------------------------
+
+We are looking at building a web based translator / translation
+management application. These days, i18n / l10n projects mostly get
+translations done from translators by exchanging PO files via Email
+which is not only slow, but also a very cumbersome process. It doesn't
+allow the project admin to track changes to the PO file and also has no
+scope to track contributions from a given translator. Moreover, with so
+many projects to be translated and so few people participating, it's
+impractical to translate most common strings automatically. There should
+also be a way to remember translations so as to save time in further
+translations and also assure a certain level of consistency of
+translations among all applications. The major issues that are being
+faced by most l10n groups today can be summarised as below --
+
+* Lack of consistency among translations
+* Lack of any translation memory
+* Inefficient use of human resources
+* Lack of decent machine translation facilities
+* Lack of versioning information in translations
+* Mostly complicated translation tools
+* Desktop or web based apps are the only ways to do translation
+* Lack of a coordinated effort among different teams
+* There is no way to contribute in small parts
+* No easy way to get the PO files as and when required
+* No new contributors are coming up
+* The overall process of getting something translated is too long
+
+To solve the above problems and to make the l10n work much smoother, we
+are proposing a web based application which will also act as a
+centralised repository of all Indic l10n work. It will act as the
+ultimate resource for all l10n volunteers. People will be able to
+contribute their translations in a very easy and user friendly way. The
+web based tool intends to achieve the following --
+
+* Act as a central repository of all Indic translations across all
+  products / languages.
+* Make the job of the translator much easier by providing a web based
+  interface.
+* Make reviewing easy by clearly separating the reviewed and unreviewed
+  messages [Once click access to unreviewed strings].
+* Make it easy for beginners to contribute to the IndLinux project.
+* Always provide up to date POT files by monitoring upstream changes.
+* Make sure translations are never lost.
+* Make it easy for new / small language teams to start translating.
+* Provide an email interface
+* Shorten the translation &lt;-&gt; review -&gt; commit process
+
+TODO: Fix the text and add some more points [must write around 1k
+words]. We also need to highlight translator management features, like
+how it will manage multiple teams of translators, do versioning of
+translations, etc. We also need to take a look at the features of
+Rosetta [<A HREF="http://lauchpad.net/rosetta">http://lauchpad.net/rosetta</A>] &amp; Pootle
+[<A HREF="http://pootle.wordforge.org">http://pootle.wordforge.org</A>] and see which  of the good features we need.

+Proposal for an Integrated Translation Management Application
+-------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Synopsis: 
+
+Translation of free &amp; open source applications - like free &amp; open source
+applications themselves, depend on the whims of would-be
+translators. There is a need for an application that will both cater to
+the need of individual translators to 'scratch their itch' and translate
+as much as they want of portions they want and at the same time allow
+the application developer to coordinate the efforts of individuals and
+maintain an adequate level of accuracy and consistency.
+
+The application should cater to both sporadic or 'one-off' online
+translation efforts and more consistent off-line efforts.
+
+In addition the application should build a basic database of strings
+with translations in the languages catered to - and offer either
+automatic translation of strings already in the database, or hints for
+already translated strings.
+
+The application should, at a later stage cater to translation of
+documentation - which has to be served to the translator para or section
+wise unlike translation of source which is served string by string.
+
+It goes without saying that the application should be free software,
+multiplatform and multilingual. It is also clear that any such
+application has to be web based.
+
+Existing efforts:
+
+We have investigated Rosetta [<A HREF="https://launchpad.net/rosetta">https://launchpad.net/rosetta</A>], Pootle
+[<A HREF="http://pootle.wordforge.org/">http://pootle.wordforge.org/</A>] and Entrans [<A HREF="http://entrans.sf.net">http://entrans.sf.net</A>].
+Rosetta is proprietory software. Pootle, written in python has the idea
+correct, but it uses a filesystem to store everything and probably wont
+scale. Entrans uses PHP and MySQL, which we feel are not stable or
+secure enough for an application of this nature - and from the
+documentation does not appear to have the comprehensive aims of this
+project. However elements of it's user interface are good and could be
+incorporated into this project.
+
+Platform:
+
+We propose using the Python scripting language with PostgreSQL RDBMS as
+a backend. The webserver will be Apache. We will be using other tools
+and frameworks not limited to Django, Subversion, Plone and Trac for
+scripting various parts of the project. Both Python and PostgreSQL are
+stable, mature and inherently secure and used worldwide on an immense
+range of products and applications. Further, python being an easy to
+master scripting language, more non-technical people will be encouraged
+to hack at and contribute to the project.
+
+Workflow:
+
+The Application developer registers an application and uploads the POT file.
+He also gives the file version. The application will treat each version of the
+PO file as a different file. The developer may opt for automatic
+translation, in which case all the strings available in the database will
+be translated into all the languages available and saved as drafts.
+Similarly, any translation by a non authorised translator will also be
+saved as drafts as and when they are done. The developer, and anyone
+authorised by him can approve of drafts, wholly or partially and merge them
+into the official version. This official version will be presented to all
+translators who wish to translate the file wholly or partially.
+
+All translations of strings in all official versions will be added to the
+database. In case of more than one translation of a string into a given
+lanuguage, all translations will be added and it is left to individual
+developers to choose the one they want.
+
+There will be a facility for experts in particular languages to review the
+database and cull out obviously incorrect translations, correct spellings,
+mark any one translation as 'preferred' and remove almost identical duplic
+ates. 
+
+Translators will be able to use the online interface as well as upload
+translations made offline. Submitting translations by email will also be
+catered to, but this will not have an automatic interface. The developer
+will have to accept responsibility for accepting email submissions and the
+translator will have to get the consent of the developer to submit by
+email.
+
+Proposed Features:
+------------------
+
+Statistics:
+
+The application will provide detailed statistics of the number of
+strings translated. This can also be filtered according to the project,
+language, translator as well as different project versions.
+
+Online Review:
+
+An system for reviewing the translations online will be present so as to
+help trusted reviewers to just login to the system and review the
+translations. 
+
+Consistency Checking:
+
+The application will automatically check the consistency of the
+translations and will report errors if any for fixes. In case of a
+broken translation, the official version will be switched to the last
+sane translation until the broken [but newer] version is fixed and
+committed.
+
+Version Control:
+
+A basic form of version control will be present in the app. It will be
+able to track translations of the same application across different
+versions and will also allow merging &amp; diffing between the
+versions. Also, it will make sure translations are never lost.
+
+Downloads:
+
+Translators will be able to download tarballs of translated files
+according to projects, project versions and languages. This will help in
+case they want to translate offline.
+
+Translated UI:
+
+The UI of the application itself will be translated into various indian
+langauges so as to allow translators use the application in their own
+native language.
+
+Extensive Online Documentation:
+
+Documentation is very important in a project and we will provide an
+extensive documentation for the application so that it's easy for the
+translators / admins to pick it up and start using.
+
+Email Interface:
+
+As already pointed out, we intend to provide an Email interface to the
+application so that authenticated translators can recieve untranslated
+strings and send translations by Email.
+
+Screenshot Gallery:
+
+There will be a screenhot gallery which will have screenshots of various
+translated applications to inspire more people to join the i18n / l10n
+scene as well as to show the status of translations for a particular
+language / project.
+
+Schedule:
+
+We will have a server up and running with a basic version of the
+application within a month of starting the project. Working with active
+developers and translators, the application will be fine-tuned over a
+period of 6 months to a year.
+
+Proposed Roadmap:
+
+01 Month:
+   * Database structure and translation user interface - basic functionality
+   * One language
+   * Beta 1 release
+
+03 Months:
+   * Complete admin and user interface added
+   * Any number of languages
+
+06 Months:
+   * Handling of diffs, statistics, reports - complete functionality
+   * Beta 2 release.
+
+08 Months:
+   * Addition of email interface and interface for translation of documents
+   * Bug fixes and UI translations into at least 3 languages.
+   * First Release Candidate release.
+
+10 Months:
+   * Factoring
+   * More UI Translations and documentation.
+   * Second Release Candidate release.
+
+11 Months:
+   * Feature freeze.
+   * Big fixes, UI translations.
+   * More documentation.
+   * Third Release Candidate release.
+
+12 Months:
+   * More bug fixing.
+   * Clearing up Docs &amp; UI translations.
+   * First stable release.
+
+The timeline is dependent on the amount of response we get from testers and
+and translators - features will be added and modified in response to the
+feedback.
+
+
+  
+Funding:
+
+1. We'll initially require 6 months funding to create the application
+   with the most important features. Preferably we'd like to receive an
+   additional 6 months of funding to incorporate more advanced features
+   like machine translation and other nifty things as well as doing a
+   lot of bug fixing, achieve full UI translations and writing test
+   cases, etc.
+   
+2. Hosting space with root access along with Subversion, Python, Apache
+   mod_python, PostgreSQL and a few GB of diskspace - $400 per year is
+   the going rate.
